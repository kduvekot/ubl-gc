# Trigger file for build-work-history workflow
#
# Modify this file (e.g. update the timestamp below) and push to trigger
# the Build UBL Work History Branch workflow on GitHub Actions.
#
# This provides an explicit trigger mechanism that is completely isolated
# from the official build-history workflow (which triggers on scripts/ changes).
#
# Alternatively, use workflow_dispatch for manual triggering via the GitHub UI.
#
# Last triggered: not yet
