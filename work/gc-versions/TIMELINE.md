# UBL 2.5 GC File Timeline: Artifacts vs History

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Working directory:** `work/gc-versions/` (copies only — history/ NOT modified)

## How the Existing history/ Files Map to Artifact Versions

### history/csd02-UBL-2.5/ — CORRECT

| File | SHA-256 | Artifact Match | Status |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| mod/UBL-Entities-2.5.gc | `fa9822e180f7...` | **Entities V5** | Published Dec 3, 2025 |
| mod/UBL-Signature-Entities-2.5.gc | `1104e26913cb...` | **Signature V1** | Stable Nov 17 – Feb 9 |
| endorsed/mod/UBL-Endorsed-Entities-2.5.gc | `0c9365e918f3...` | **Endorsed V5** | Published Dec 3, 2025 |

V5 was the content generated by the Dec 3 builds (artifacts 4750371329 and
4751186216). These are the officially published CSD02 files.

### history/csd01-UBL-2.5/ — RETROACTIVELY REGENERATED

| File | SHA-256 | Size | Artifact Match | Issue |
|------|---------|------|---------------|-------|
| mod/UBL-Entities-2.5.gc | `4ad8dd25...` | 8,702,571 | csd01 ref **V2** (Jan 21+) | NOT the original published CSD01 |
| mod/UBL-Signature-Entities-2.5.gc | `23ecf98e...` | 13,871 | csd01 Sig ref (stable) | OK — unchanged |
| endorsed/mod/UBL-Endorsed-Entities-2.5.gc | `9206aafb...` | 8,366,420 | csd01 Endorsed ref **V2** (Jan 21+) | NOT the original |

**What happened:** On Jan 21, 2026, the CSD01 reference files in the oasis-tcs/ubl
git repo were regenerated with new columns (`EndorsedCardinality`,
`EndorsedCardinalityRationale`). The actual entity data is the same, but the schema
was extended to support CSD02/CSD03 NDR comparison.

| | Original CSD01 (V1) | history/ CSD01 (V2) | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entities | 8,060,928 bytes | 8,702,571 bytes | +641,643 (+8%) |
| Endorsed | 5,484,544 bytes | 8,366,420 bytes | +2,881,876 (+53%) |
| Signature | 13,871 bytes | 13,871 bytes | unchanged |
| Entities lines | baseline | +16,066 lines | New column data |
| Endorsed lines | baseline | +73,617 lines | Near-complete rewrite |

Original CSD01 V1 files are preserved in:
`work/gc-versions/csd01-ref/V1-original-*.gc`

### UBL-Endorsed-Entities-2.5.gc (10 versions)

Changes in lockstep with Entities at every transition point.
Same version numbering. Always byte-identical to UBL-Endorsed-Entities-2.4-os.gc
in the same artifact (this is a bug in the build system — 2.4-os should be static).

### UBL-Signature-Entities-2.5.gc (2 versions)

| V | Date | Change | Stage |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| V1 | Nov 17 – Feb 9 14:45 | Stable 3 months | CSD02 |
| V2 | Feb 9 14:46+ | CSD02→CSD03 header only | CSD03 |

### CSD01 Reference Files (2 versions each for Entities/Endorsed)

| V | Date | Source | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| V1 | Published Aug 20, 2025 | Original OASIS publication | In artifacts Nov 17 – Jan 21 |
| V2 | Regenerated Jan 21, 2026 | Git repo update | +641KB Entities, +2.9MB Endorsed |
